<b>Neutral's bandits</b><p>
These bandits are lurking around and can be found almost anywhere in this land. 
Be carefull although they tend not to interfere with our business, they might attack 
us if we are off guarded.<p>
<b>Elephant Rider</b><p>
Your kingdom's long lost legendary Elephant Rider can be used against the Prince's Knight.
These units are strong in offensive, defensive and move as fast as a horseman. They 
require substantial training so we need to assign more people onto the barrack to 
train one of them quickly enough.<p>
You can train these units by concentrating research on social advances. First, go to one
of your towns, then click on the research text on the right hand corner of the town panel.
On the research popup, select social advances on the right hand side and allocate some
money into the research. Please note that discoveries do not come automatically with 
your research investment, there is a chance that you might obtain a particular technology 
or discovery. To increase this chance, build or capture more towns or invest more money 
into research.
