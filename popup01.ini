<b>Strategies</b><p>
My lord, we should save our resources to build military units. Food is very important
as population will only increase when the city's food storage reached a high value.
Once we have several young citizens, we should form new army to venture out.<p>
<b>Healing your units</b><p>
Your units need supplies to fight effectively and heal their wounded. Therefore, 
you need to load some resources, especially <b>food</b>. Before a long journey, 
be sure to load plenty of food so your units can heal while there are no nearby 
cities.<p>
<b>Travelling</b><p>
Usually travelling at sea is much faster than on land. Your land units can tow your
boats on land but at slow speed.<p>
<b>Leader</b><p>
Leader are combat unit that has leadership skill. A leader increase the army combat 
points and reorganize the army better. Higher leadership skill affects more on army 
morale and combat effectiveness.<p>
<b>Technologies</b><p>
You can research new technologies or advancements that will allow to build new units, 
houses or upgrade your existing units. There are units that are available only to you, use them to your advantage. But remember, your opponents also have their unique units.<p>
<b>Building cities</b><p>
You will be able to build cities using your settlers or any of your units. 
Once settled into cities or towns, your units will become citizens.
However, they dont loose their abilities. To get them back into armies, simply have 
an army positioned over the town/cities then click/select the units inside the town/cities
and then click on the button <b>enlist</b>.<p>
<b>Capturing enemy's units</b><p>
It is essential at the beginning to capture some enemy's workers or boats. To do this 
we need to knock out all military units in an enemy company and make sure our company 
has enough room. Then attack, the non-combatant units will be captured.
